## A short history of handling spatial data in R

* pre-2003: several people doing spatial statistics or map manipulation with S-Plus, and later R (e.g. spatial in MASS; spatstat, maptools, geoR, splancs, ...)
* 2003: workshop at [DSC](https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2003/), agreement that a package with base classes would be useful
* 2003: start of [r-sig-geo](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo)
* 2003: [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgdal) released on CRAN
* 2005: [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp) released on CRAN
* 2008: we published [Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R](http://www.asdar-book.org/)
* 2011: [rgeos](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgeos) released on CRAN
* 2013: second edition of [Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R](http://www.asdar-book.org/)
